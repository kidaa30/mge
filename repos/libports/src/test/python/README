This directory contains a sample python interpreter called 'test-python'.

When building this test program, a shared library 'python.lib.so' will be
generated. This library is based on the original code of Python-2.6.4 available
from the Python website.

:Python website: [http://www.python.org]

Usage
-----
Call 'make prepare' from within the 'libports' directory. Add 'libports' to
your build.conf file. A sample Genode configuration is provided with the
'python.run' script located at 'libports/run/'. It starts a Python script can
be found within this directory. If you are not using Linux as a Genode base
platform, do not forget to add 'python.lib.so' to your boot module list.

Import
-----------
The import of standard modules is currently supported by using the built-in 
zipimporter. For this, a zip file containing all the required .py or .pyc files
must be provided as a rom module. In order to import a module from a Python
script, the PYTHONPATH must be set to the zip file, e.g.:

  import sys
  sys.path = ['python26.zip']
  # now we can import modules from python26.zip
  import os
